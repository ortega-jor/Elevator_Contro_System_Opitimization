# Elevator Control System Optimization

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation and simulation results of a two-elevator control system developed as a final project for the Control System Engineering course (EECE 5659).

---

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to design, implement, and compare multiple control strategies for the operation and coordination of two elevators in a multi-floor building. The elevator control algorithms aim to reduce total service time, minimize energy use, and ensure balanced request handling between elevators.

## Controllers Implemented

### ðŸ”¹ First Call Controller (FCC)
- Simultaneous two-elevator operation using `parfeval`
- Assigns requests based on their order of arrival
- Implements locking and parallel pools to avoid conflict

### ðŸ”¹ Closest Call Controller (CCC)
- Assigns each request to the physically closest elevator
- Operates sequentially (only one elevator active at a time)

### ðŸ”¹ Optimized Multi-Elevator Controller (OMEC)
- Most advanced solution
- Groups and fulfills multiple requests in the same direction
- Maintains parallel operation with worker pools and dynamic request filtering

---

## Key Features

- Real-time simulation of elevator behavior using MATLAB
- Shared `.mat` file for dynamic request handling (`requests_queue`)
- Elevator movement logic with pickup/drop-off delays
- Output log written to text files for real-time monitoring
- `parfeval` used for parallel execution in FCC and OMEC
